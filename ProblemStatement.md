# Problem Statement

Write a program which can parse MongoDB operations log (Oplog) and generate equivalent SQL statements.

We have a scenario where an organisation was using MongoDB at the start but now needs to move to a RDBMS database. This data transition can be made easy if we can find a way to convert the JSON documents in MongoDB collections to equivalent rows in relational DB tables. That's the purpose of this program.

The MongoDB server generates the Oplog which is an ordered collection of all the write operations (insert, update, delete) to the MongoDB. Your job is to parse these oplogs and generate equivalent SQL statements.

There’s already an open source tool, [stampede](https://github.com/torodb/stampede), that converts MongoDB oplogs to sql; we are simply attempting to develop an implementation in Go.

A sample MongoDB oplog looks like:

```json
{
  "op" : "i",
  "ns" : "test.student",
  "o" : {
    "_id" : "635b79e231d82a8ab1de863b",
    "name" : "Selena Miller",
    "roll_no" : 51,
    "is_graduated" : false,
    "date_of_birth" : "2000-01-30"
  }
}
```

The main fields in the oplog are:

- op: This indicates the type of operation. It can be `i` (insert), `u` (update), `d` (delete), `c` (command), `n` (no operation). For this implementation, we’ll only care about insert, update and delete operations.
- ns: This indicates the namespace. Namespace consists of database and collection name separated by a `.` In above case, database name is `test` and collection name is `student`.
- o: This indicates the new data for insert or update operation. In above case, a student document is inserted in the collection.

The oplog contains some other fields like version, timestamp, etc. but for our consideration, we can ignore those.

We have divided the problem statement into multiple stories. You’re supposed to implement the stories.

Note: All these stories are dependent on each other. i.e. stories (and their test cases) need to be executed sequentially for it to work.

## Story 1

Parse the insert oplog JSON and convert that into equivalent SQL insert statement. When inserting a record, check if the table exists. If not, create it first.

Here’s the mapping of MongoDB concepts to their equivalent relational database concepts

- Database in MongoDB maps to schema in relational database
- Collection in MongoDB maps to table in relational database
- A single JSON document in MongoDB maps typically to a row in relational database.

Sample Input:

```json
{
  "op" : "i",
  "ns" : "test.student",
  "o" : {
    "_id" : "635b79e231d82a8ab1de863b",
    "name" : "Selena Miller",
    "roll_no" : 51,
    "is_graduated" : false,
    "date_of_birth" : "2000-01-30"
  }
}
```

Expected Output:

```sql
INSERT INTO test.student
            (_id,
             NAME,
             roll_no,
             is_graduated,
             date_of_birth)
VALUES      ('635b79e231d82a8ab1de863b',
             'Selena Miller',
             51,
             false,
             '2000-01-30');
```

You can assume that the above oplog is generated by following MongoDB command that inserts some data in student table.

```sql
use test;

db.student.insertOne(
	{
	name: "Selena Miller", 
	roll_no:51, 
	is_graduated:false, 
	date_of_birth: "2000-01-30"
	}
);
```

Assumptions:

- The `op` key indicates the operation. `i` stands for insert operation.
- The oplog contains some other fields like version, timestamp, etc. but for our consideration, we can ignore those. Hence, the above oplog contains only the fields which are relevant for our SQL conversion use case.
- The `ns` key indicates a combination of db name and collection name. In above example, db name is `test` and collection name is `student`. Db name and collection name will be separated by a `.`
- For simplicity, for now, assume that there are no nested objects in the Mongo collection.

Expectations:

- Your code should be generic enough to extract the db and collection name from `ns` field. It should also extract following types from JSON - string, boolean and number. In above example, `name` is a string variable, `roll_no` is a number variable and `is_graduated` is boolean. For now, you can treat `date_of_birth` as string (and not a date field type)

## Instructions

1. You will have to create a new repo in language of your choice (Java, Go, etc)
2. Use the [example-input.json](example-input.json) file as the input to the program.
3. The output should be an `output.sql` file which has the correct SQL statements to prepare the SQL database. You can compare your output with [example-output.sql](example-output.sql). 
4. If something is unclear, try to figure out the solution, given the test cases. If something is still unclear, assume what you think is right and make a note in the readme.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. The code should provide the necessary documentation to run the program.
2. The code should produce correct output for the given input.
3. The code should have necessary tests.
4. Bonus points for code quality and best practices.
